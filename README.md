# Greek Mythology Quiz Game

An engaging trivia game about Greek mythology, built using the [quiz-game-kit](https://github.com/zevaverbach/quiz-game-kit) framework.

## Features

- 🏛️ Over 200 questions about Greek gods, heroes, and myths
- 📊 Track your progress and accuracy
- 🔥 Build up streaks for correct answers
- 🎊 Celebratory confetti animations
- 💾 Local storage saves your progress
- 📱 Fully responsive design

## Architecture

This game uses a modular architecture powered by quiz-game-kit:

- **questions.js** - Greek mythology questions and answers
- **theme.css** - Greek-themed styling (gold, marble, purple)
- **index.html** - HTML structure
- **quiz-game-kit/** - Reusable quiz engine and core styles

## How It Works

The game imports the quiz engine and styles from the quiz-game-kit repository, then customizes them with Greek mythology content and theming. This modular approach makes it easy to:

- Update the quiz engine for all games at once
- Create new quiz games on different topics
- Customize the look and feel per topic

## Play the Game

Simply open `index.html` in a web browser. No build process or dependencies required!
